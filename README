Quick usage
-----------
Requires Oracle Java 8 Runtime.

The program can be downloaded in JAR format from the teams jenkins server.
The name of the jar will be something along the lines of your_project_name-<version>-SNAPSHOT.jar

To run JAR under Linux mint, right click on the jar file, select "open with" and then "Oracle Java 8 Runtime".
To JAR can also be run from the command line using the command below:

	java -jar <name-of-the-jarfile>

Replacing <name-of-the-jar-file> with the name of the JAR file downloaded from jenkins.


Building from Source
--------------------
To build from source, you need to have maven installed along with Oracle Java SDK 8.
(Preferably the latest version, but older versions of maven may work.)

From the source directory run the command:

	mvn package

This will produce an executable jar in the ./target directory which can be run
using the same commands and the JAR above.
